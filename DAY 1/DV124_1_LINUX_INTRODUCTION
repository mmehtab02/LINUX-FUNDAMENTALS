WHAT IS AN OS? - WRITE, BROWSE INTERNET, WATCH VIDEO - HOW DOES HARDWARE WORK LIKE THAT? RUN MP3 FILE, OTHER THINGS.

OS OR KERNEL DOES THIS WORK

KERNEL IS PROGRAM AT THE HEART OF ANY OS THAT ALLOWS HARDWARE TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOFTWARE

TO USE A SYSTEM YOU NEED AN OS

WINDOWS, APPLE OSX, LINUX

WHAT IS LINUX? WHO CREATED IT?

LINUX IS AN OS/KERNEL CREATED BY LINUS TORVALDS.

HE USED TO WORK ON UNIX OS AND THOUGHT IT NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS.

UNIX DESIGNERS REJECTED.

HE CREATED LINUX WHICH IS RECEPTIVE TO CHANGES, MODIFICATIONS BY ITS USERS.

HE COLLABORATED WITH OTHER PROGRAMMERS (MIT, ETC.) AND APPLICATIONS STARTED TO APPEAR.

LINUX - OPEN SOURCE

EARLY VERSIONS WERE NOT USER FRIENDLY.

POPULARITY DROPPED AS WINDOWS GOT FAMOUS, FOR EXAMPLE.

THE OPEN SOURCE ASPECT MADE LINUX MORE ROBUST.

LINUX GOT ATTENTION, THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF LINUX WAS PROGRAMMERS WERE ABLE TO USE THE LINUX KERNELS TO DESIGN THEIR OWN CUSTOM OPERATING SYSTEMS.

NOW LINUX IS POPULAR AND WIDELY USED KERNEL - BACKBONE FOR DISTRIBUTIONS LIKE UBUNTU, DEBIAN, FEDORA.

THOUSANDS OF OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT OFFER A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS TO USERS.

BENEFITS OF LINUX? POPULAR AND FAMOUS AMONGST PROGRAMMERS AND REGULAR COMPUTER USERS AROUND THE WORLD.

MAIN BENEFIT - FREE OS.

OPEN SOURCE - ANYONE WITH PROGRAMMING KNOWLEDGE CAN MODIFY IT.

LINUX OS’S NOW OFFER MILLIONS OF PROGRAMS/APPS TO CHOOSE FROM MOST OF THEM FREE.

WITH LINUX YOU NO LONGER NEED AN ANTIVIRUS. IT IS A HIGHLY SECURE SYSTEM.

GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY LOOKS CONSTANTLY TO ENHANCE SECURITY.

WITH EACH UPGRADE, THE OS BECOMES MORE SECURE AND ROBUST.

IT IS THE CHOICE FOR SERVER ENVIRONMENTS DUE TO ITS STABILITY AND RELIABILITY.

AMAZON, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, ETC. USE LINUX FOR SERVERS.

A LINUX BASED SERVER CAN RUN NON-STOP WITHOUT A REBOOT FOR YEARS ON END.

USERS SHUN IT BY CONSIDERING IT A TECHNICAL AND DIFFICULT SYSTEM TO OPERATE.

LINUX OS’S ARE BECOMING USER FRIENDLY. TRY ME.

UNIX VS. LINUX?

UNIX IS THE MOTHER OF THE OS’S WHICH LAID OUT FOUNDATION FOR LINUX.

UNIX - MAINFRAMES - ENTERPRISES, UNIVERSITIES. MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR UNIX KERNEL.

LINUX - COMPUTER USERS, DEVELOPERS, SERVER ENVIRONMENTS. LINUX IS FREE.

COMMANDS USED IN BOTH OS’S IS THE SAME. NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE. THE CORE IS THE SAME. LINUX IS A CLONE OF UNIX. LEARNING ONE IS THE SAME AS LEARNING ANOTHER.
