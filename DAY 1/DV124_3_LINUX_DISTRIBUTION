RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX - TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

LINUX DISTRIBUTION - INSTALLABLE OS BUILT FROM THE LINUX KERNEL AND SUPPORTING USER PROGRAMS AND LIBRARIES THAT YOU NEED TO ASSEMBLE A COMPLETE SYSTEM.

LARGE COLLECTION OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS. EACH WORKING WITH INDIVIDUAL SOFTWARE COMPONENTS.

DISTRO - PROVIDES EASY WAY FOR END USERS TO INSTALL AND MANAGE A WORKING LINUX SYSTEM.

WHEN LINUX WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED DISTROS DIDN’T EXIST. EARLY DEV DOWNLOAD KERNEL, USE TOOLS TO COMPILE AND INSTALL ON SYSTEM, COMPILE INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS, DOWNLOAD FROM FTP WEBSITE, DIFFERENT SOFTWARE COMMUNITIES. ASSEMBLE BY HAND.

DISTRIBUTION OF TOOLS - NEW DEVS AND USERS CAN QUICKLY SET UP LINUX SYSTEMS.

MANY USE CASES, DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES - MANY DIFFERENT LINUX DISTROS, EACH WITH DIFFERENT GOALS, CRITERIA FOR SELECTING AND SUPPORTING SOFTWARE THAT IS INCLUDED IN OS.

DISTRO WILL CONSIST OF GENERALLY - KERNEL, SOME SUPPORTING USER SPACE PROGRAMS.

PHONE APP (NOT MUCH) OR THOUSANDS OF APPS AVAILABLE.

DISTRO VENDOR HAS TO ACT AS CURATOR TO SELECT PROGRAMS AND ITS VERSIONS THEY WILL SUPPORT, EASY WAY TO INSTALL AND UPDATE SOFTWARE.

INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPING PROGRAMS UPSTREAM IF THEY WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE LIKE THAT.

ROLE OF DISTRO VENDOR LOOK AT MILLION+ OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS OUT THERE. BE INVOLVED WITH THEM (THE ONES THEY DISTRIBUTE). INTEGRATE THEIR PRODUCTS, MAKE SURE THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY STABILIZED FOR THEIR CUSTOMER BASE.

BASIC MODEL RED HAT USES.




FEDORA, RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX (2 DISTROS RED HAT IS INVOLVED WITH)

FEDORA - COMMUNITY-DRIVEN LINUX DISTRO, RED HAT IS PRIMARY SPONSOR. THE DIRECTION IS DRIVEN BY THE PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY (HELPING TO DEVELOP THIS FAST MOVING DISTRO)

RED HAT’S INTEREST IN FEDORA PROVIDES A WAY TO DO THAT 2ND STEP - INITIAL INTEGRATION, SELECT THINGS THAT LOOK INTERESTING FROM THE MILLIONS OF PACKAGES THAT ARE OUT THERE, START GETTING THEM INTEGRATED, TESTED, PLAYED WITH, EXPERIMENTED WITH BY THE COMMUNITY TO SEE ONE'S PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN, WHICH ONES ARE SUCCESSFUL.

RED HAT DOESN’T DIRECT THE FEDORA PROJECT:

FEDORA COUNCIL (RED HAT REPRESENTATIVES, COMMUNITY SELECTED REPS. THAT PLAY HIGH LEVEL PROJECT GOALS AND MANAGE FINANCES)

FEDORA ENGINEERING STEERING COMMITTEE (FESCo) - THEIR JOB TO MAKE TECHNICAL DECISIONS FOR DIRECTION FOR THE DISTRO (SELECT PACKAGES TO INCLUDE, DETERMINE ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES DISTRO WANTS TO MAKE, HANDLING OVERSIGHT OF MAINTAINERS THAT ARE VOLUNTEERING TO ASSIST WITH PROJECT).

THIS LATTER IS ENTIRELY SELECTED BY COMMUNITY.

FEDORA IS A STABLE AND SECURE LINUX DISTRO FOCUSED ON NEW FREE OPEN SOURCE TECH.

THEIR FOCUS THOUGH IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT A COMMERCIAL ORG. MIGHT WANT FOR THE LONG TERM. THEY ARE FOCUSED ON INNOVATION, EXCELLENCE, TRYING NEW THINGS, NOT LONG TERM STABILITY. MAJOR UPDATE OF DISTRO EVERY 6 MONTHS, AFTER 2 UPDATES (1 YEAR) OLD VERSIONS NOT SUPPORTED.

THIS HAS AN ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMMUNITY, IT PROVIDES A SOLID DISTRO FOR DEVELOPING NEW TECH BEFORE USED IN THE ENTERPRISE. ADVANTAGE FOR RED HAT BECAUSE IT’S A PLACE TO INTEGRATE AND IMPROVE THAT NEW TECH BEFORE IT GOES INTO A COMMERCIALLY LONG TERM SUPPORTED PROJECT.

BUT FOR AN ORG THAT IS TRYING TO SUPPORT A SERVER FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, FEDORA MIGHT NOT BE THE IDEAL CHOICE.

RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX - WHEN WE GET TO THE STABILIZATION PHASE, RED HAT LOOKS AT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON IN FEDORA. FROM THAT BASELINE THEY DEVELOPED RHEL A COMMERCIALLY SUPPORTED LINUX DISTRO.

THIS ISN’T JUST A COLLECTION OF MATURE AND WELL TESTED OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS, THIS IS AN INTEGRATED, COMPLETE, ENTERPRISE READY PROJECT.

LONG TERM SUPPORT IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE HERE. RED HAT SUPPORTS VERSIONS OF THIS DISTRO FOR 10 YEARS FROM THE INITIAL RELEASE OF A NEW MAJOR VERSION.

THEY STAY ON PARTICULAR SOFTWARE VERSIONS IN GENERAL BUT BACK PORT FIXES OR NEW FEATURES OVER THE LIFETIME OVER RHEL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE SOLUTION AND KEEP IT STABLE OVER THE LONG TERM.

RHEL IS BASED ON FEDORA BUT THEY PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH PACKAGES THEY ARE GOING TO SUPPORT FOR THE LONG TERM. THEY DON’T INCLUDE EVERYTHING FEDORA INCLUDES.

SOMETIMES THEY MAKE FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS BEYOND WHAT FEDORA HAS DONE. WHEN THEY DO THEY PASS THOSE ENHANCEMENTS BACK UPSTREAM TO FEDORA SO THEY CAN ADOPT THEM AS WELL IN TRUE OPEN SOURCE SPIRIT.

THIS ALLOWS TO MAKE CONFIGURATION DECISIONS IN RHEL TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WHICH MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE USING THE FEDORA PROJECT.

RHEL AND COMMUNITY - THERE’S A NUMBER OF WAYS THIS ALL FITS IN WITH THE COMMUNITY. CUSTOMERS ENGAGE WITH RED HAT TO HELP DETERMINE THE NEEDS OF THE NEXT RELEASE OF RHEL. VENDORS CAN ENGAGE WITH RED HAT TO MAKE SURE THEIR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IS WELL SUPPORTED IN RHEL. RED HAT HELPS CUSTOMERS AND VENDORS ENGAGE WITH THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY - THEY CAN HELP THE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED HAPPEN IN THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY, HAPPEN UPSTREAM, AND BACK TO COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT THEM FOR THE LONG TERM AS WELL AS THE CHANGES CAN BE SHARED WITH EVERYONE WHO IS WORKING WITH VARIOUS LINUX DISTROS.

SUBSCRIPTIONS - IT’S OPEN SOURCE, YOU AREN’T PAYING FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE YOU ARE PAYING FOR THE EXPERTISE, COMMITMENT, ASSISTANCE WITH THE SOFTWARE, ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT WHEN YOU NEED IT. WHEN NEW VERSIONS ARE AVAILABLE YOU CAN OBTAIN AND MOVE TO THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY IT’S PART OF THE SUBSCRIPTION. YOU DON’T HAVE TO PAY MORE.

SOME ADVANTAGES OF RHEL THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION MODEL :





WE CAN SEE THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS DISTROS ENGAGE WITH THEIR COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE SUPPORT. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES.

BEYOND LINUX - THIS DISTRIBUTION MODEL HAS PROVEN TO BE SO POWERFUL THAT IT IS NOW USED BEYOND THE CORE LINUX OS.

ESPECIALLY THE 2 PHASE MODEL - OPEN INTEGRATION BEFORE PROVIDING A COMMERCIALLY SUPPORTED PRODUCT. IT IS USED BEYOND THE CORE LINUX OS.

THIS MODEL IS USED TO TEST AND SOLIDIFY AND SUPPORT MANY PRODUCTS BY WORKING WITH THE UPSTREAM COMMUNITY AND INTEGRATING THAT INTO PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE SUPPORTED COMMERCIALLY FOR THE LONG TERM.
