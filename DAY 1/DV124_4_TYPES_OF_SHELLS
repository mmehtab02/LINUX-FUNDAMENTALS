WHAT IS SHELL AND TYPES OF SHELLS ON LINUX

SHELL IS A PROGRAM THAT WILL TAKE THE COMMANDS FROM INPUT DEVICES (KEYBOARD) AND EXECUTE IT ON THE SHELL.

THE SHELL PASSES THE COMMAND TO THE KERNEL, THE KERNEL WILL GO TO THE HARDWARE AND EXECUTE AND GET REPLY FROM HARDWARE TO THE KERNEL BACK TO THE SHELL.

SHELL DISPLAYS AGAIN THE OUTPUT.

ls → shell sends command to kernel, execute quickly

Different shells

cat /etc/shells (LIST SHELLS)

SH VS. BASH - LOOK LIKE SAME, MOST COMMANDS EXECUTE

THERE ARE DIFFERENCES

BASH - JOB CONTROLS, CREATE ALIASES, COMMAND LINE HISTORY AND EDITING, ETC.

SH - ORIGINAL SHELL UNIX, SIMPLE LIGHTWEIGHT LIMITED FEATURES, MOSTLY USED FOR SCRIPTING PURPOSES AND RUNNING BASIC COMMANDS, LACKS ADVANCED FEATURES (EX: COMMAND LINE COMPLETION, INTERACTIVE HISTORY). AVAILABLE ON ALMOST ALL UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS.

BASH - ONE OF MOST POPULAR AND WIDELY USED SHELLS, OFFERS BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY UPGRADE TO SH (MOST SH SCRIPTS WILL WORK WITH BASH), ADDITIONAL FEATURES, HAS BECOME DEFAULT SHELL FOR MANY LINUX DISTROS AND MACOS.

/bin/sh (ENTER SH TERMINAL)
ls,clear,exit

/usr/sbin/nologin - CANNOT LOGIN TO MACHINE
SPECIAL SHELL TO DENY INTERACTIVE LOGIN ACCESS. CANNOT ACCESS SSH OR CONSOLE.
/etc/passwd - CONTAINS EACH USER ACCOUNT WITH ASSOCIATED DEFAULT LOGIN SHELL. LOGIN SHELL IS PROGRAM EXECUTED WHEN USER LOGS INTO SYSTEM.

THIS PROVIDE ACCESS TO USER FOR CERTAIN TASKS WHILE PREVENTING FROM LOGGING IN AND ACCESSING COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE.

CAN BE IN /sbin/nologin AS WELL.
/bin/false - IMMEDIATE LOGOUT
‘rsh’ - LIMITATIONS ON COMMANDS TO EXECUTE

/bin/tcsh
/bin/csh
USED FOR PROGRAMMING DEVS TO USE ‘C LANGUAGE’ AS SHELL SCRIPTING. MORE FAMILIARITY AND FLEXIBILITY ON THE TERMINALS FOR THEM.

TCSH ENHANCED VERSION OF CSH
TENEX C SHELL, C SHELL.
