WINDOWS, MAC OS?

LINUX TECHNICALLY REFERS TO KERNEL. BASE STRUCTURE OR FRAMEWORK AN OS IS BUILT AROUND.


GNU LINUX REFERS TO WHOLE PACKAGE (GNU SOFTWARE + LINUX KERNEL)

LINUX VS WINDOWS?

LINUX - OPEN SOURCE - CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPMENT, MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE SOURCE CODE. MANY OS’S

UBUNTU, CHROME OS, ANDROID

RUNNING ON MANY THINGS - ATM MACHINES, GOVT FACILITIES, NASA, AMAZON, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE USE LINUX IN SOME WAY, MOST WEB SERVERS, ETC.

FAST DEVELOPMENT THANKS TO MANY CONTRIBUTORS ACROSS THE GLOBE.

NEW KERNEL EVERY 3 MONTHS VS. EVERY 3 YEARS FOR WINDOWS.

MORE SECURE THAN WINDOWS DUE TO ACCOUNT PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT.

LINUX VS. MAC OS?

DISTANT COUSINS.

UNIX → BSD (MODIFIED) → DARWIN
UNIX → LINUX (LIKE UNIX) → GNU LINUX

AT&T CREATED UNIX IN LATE 60S. WASN’T OPEN SOURCE AND HAD TO BE LICENSED OUT.

LINUS TORVALDS CREATES A KERNEL LIKE UNIX WITHOUT ANY PROPRIETARY CODE.

INDIRECTLY MAC OS USES UNIX WHICH IS GRANDFATHER FOR LINUX.

COMPATIBILITY AND USER FRIENDLINESS - REASONS PEOPLE MAY NOT USE LINUX.

STEAM NOT ALL AAA TITLES FOUND ON LINUX, OTHER MAC OS SOFTWARE NOT COMPATIBLE.

LINUX NOT THAT USER FRIENDLY.
