rmdir -(options) (dir)

mkdir abc

rmdir abc

mkdir -p a/b/c/d/e

ls -R

rmdir a/b/c/d/e (not working) (only removed top level directory {e})

rmdir -p a/b/c/d (now works)

mkdir -p a/b/c/d/e
rmdir -pv a/b/c/d/e (shows how the command works)

create again…
cd a/b/
cat > abc.txt (create file)
cd ../..

ls -R

rmdir -pv a/b/c/d/e (error to remove a/b) (remove e/d/c because they are empty)

if a directory contains a file, the rmdir command will not work for that directory.

rm command…..

rm a/b (error)
rm -rv a/b (recursive delete)

only deleted the b file, and the b directory

rm -rv a - this will delete everything. give the parent directory with this command.
