cp (options) (source) (destination)
        -i -v etc.    source file/dir   dest

2 dirs, 1 file

copy file into new file (copy and create file)
cp file1.txt file2.txt

copy file into directory
cp file1.txt dir1

cp file1.txt file2.txt dir2
    (multiple source)

cp file1.txt file2.txt dir1 (will overwrite file1.txt since it already exists there)

to avoid overwrite :

cp -i (ask before overwrite)

cd dir1

cp ../file1.txt ../file2.txt .      (copy file 1 and 2 from parent dir into current dir)

cp -i ../file1.txt ../file2.txt /home/ubuntu/dir1    (absolute path same as ^)

cp dir1 dir3 (error) (dir contains files, unable to copy to new dir)

cp -r dir1 dir3 (if dir has files, use recursive)

IF DIRECTORY DOESNâ€™T EXIST, ONLY FILES TRANSFERRED.

IF DIRECTORY (DESTINATION) EXISTS, ENTIRE SOURCE DIR IS COPIED.

man cp
