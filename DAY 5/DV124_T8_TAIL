The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969,
at AT&T's Bell Labs, in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis
Ritchie, Douglas Mcllroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was
written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time.
In 1973 in a key, pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the C programming
language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O
routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix
made its porting to different computer platforms easier.

for about half a year. Torvalds had already considered the name "Linux", but
initially dismissed it as too egotistical
