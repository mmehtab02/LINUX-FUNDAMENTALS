LINUX - EVERYTHING IS A FILE

SPECIAL FILES FOR HARDWARE DEVICES, SYSTEM INFO, OTHER THINGS.

DIRECTORY IS A FILE CONTAINING OTHER FILES.


______________________________________________________________________

ORDINARY / REGULAR FILES - CONTAINS DATA AS STREAM OF CHARACTERS. DATA CAN BE BINARY, TEXT, MULTIMEDIA CONTENT.

(TEXT FILES, BINARY EXECUTABLES, IMAGES, VIDEOS, AUDIO, CONFIGURATION FILES, SCRIPTS, ETC.)

THIS IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF FILE IN LINUX.

EXAMPLES : FILE.TXT, DOCUMENT.DOC, SCRIPT.SH,
EXECUTABLE, IMAGE.JPG, PROGRAM.BIN,
VIDEO.MP4, AUDIO.WAV, IMAGE.PNG


______________________________________________________________________


DIRECTORY FILES - (FOLDERS) CONTAINERS FOR OTHER FILES AND SUBDIRECTORIES. THEY ORGANIZE THE FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY.

EXAMPLES : ‘HOME’ (USER HOME DIRECTORIES) ‘BIN’ (ESSENTIAL SYSTEM BINARIES) ‘ETC’ (SYSTEM CONFIGURATION FILES)
/HOME,  /USR/BIN,  /ETC

______________________________________________________________________



SPECIAL / DEVICE FILES - ALL DEVICES / PERIPHERALS / RESOURCES ARE REPRESENTED BY FILES. TO READ / WRITE A DEVICE, YOU HAVE TO PERFORM THESE INPUT / OUTPUT OPERATIONS ON ITS ASSOCIATED FILE.

ACCESS TO HARDWARE, CONTROL I/O OPERATIONS, AND MANAGE SYSTEM SETTINGS.

SPECIAL FILES ARE CHARACTERIZED AS 2 TYPES : CHARACTER SPECIAL FILES AND BLOCK SPECIAL FILES (CHARACTER AND BLOCK DEVICES).
THESE DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF DEVICE THEY REPRESENT AND THE METHOD USED FOR DATA ACCESS. THE DISTINCTION OF THESE FILE TYPES IS ESSENTIAL FOR HOW THE LINUX KERNEL INTERACTS WITH AND MANAGES VARIOUS HARDWARE DEVICES AND STORAGE MEDIA.

EXAMPLES : /DEV/SDA (HARD DISK, BLOCK), /DEV/TTY (TERMINAL, CHARACTER)
/TMP/MY_PIPE (NAMED PIPES {FIFOS}), /VAR/RUN/MYSQL.SOCK (SOCKETS)

CHARACTER STREAM FILES - CHARACTER DEVICES / CHARACTER SPECIAL FILES.
PROVIDE STREAM OF CHARACTERS OR BYTES FOR I/O.
TYPICALLY USED FOR DEVICES THAT PERFORM I/O OPERATIONS CHARACTER BY CHARACTER (TERMINALS, SERIAL PORTS, PRINTERS)
ACCESSING CHARACTER STREAM FILES INVOLVED READING/WRITING ONE CHARACTER OR BYTE AT A TIME.
EXAMPLES : /DEV/TTY - TERMINAL DEVICE, /DEV/SERIAL - SERIAL PORT ALLOWING COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL DEVICES THROUGH SERIAL COMMUNICATION, /DEV/LP0 - FIRST PARALLEL PORT USED FOR PRINTING.

BLOCK STREAM FILES - BLOCK DEVICES / BLOCK SPECIAL FILES.
PROVIDE ACCESS TO DATA IN FIXED-SIZED BLOCKS (LARGER THAN A SINGLE CHARACTER OR BYTE).
USED FOR STORAGE DEVICES LIKE HARD DRIVES, SSDS, USB DRIVES, ETC. WHERE DATA IS READ / WRITE IN BLOCKS. IMPROVED EFFICIENCY.
EXAMPLES : /DEV/SDA OR /DEV/SDB - HARD DISK, /DEV/NVME0N1 - NVME-BASED SSD, /DEV/SDX - USB DRIVES.

OTHERS - SYMBOLIC LINKS, FIFOS, SOCKETS.

______________________________________________________________________


FILE NAMES - CASE SENSITIVE, 255 CHARS MAX (UNIX BASED SYSTEMS MOST), CAN CONTAIN ANY CHARACTER (INCLUDING WHITESPACE, EXCEPT /), FILENAME EXTENSIONS NOT NEEDED AND NOT INTERPRETED. JUST USED FOR US TO DISTINGUISH FILES FOR CONVENIENCE.

FILE PATH - UNIQUE LOCATION TO FILE OR FOLDER IN A FILE SYSTEM OF AN OS. A PATH TO A FILE IS A COMBINATION OF / AND ALPHANUMERIC CHARS.
PWD - PATH WHICH IS SEQUENCE OF DIRECTORY NAMES SEPARATED BY SLASHES. THIS SHOWS OUR LOCATION WITH REFERENCE TO THE TOP WITH IS ROOT.

/ (ROOT) HOME (PARENT DIRECTORY TO:) /USER

ABSOLUTE PATH - DEFINED AS SPECIFYING THE LOCATION OF A FILE OR DIRECTORY FROM THE ROOT DIRECTORY(/). COMPLETE PATH FROM THE START OF THE FILE SYSTEM.

/HOME/USER

RELATIVE PATH - DEFINED AS PATH RELATIVE TO THE PRESENT WORKING DIRECTORY. IT STARTS AT YOUR CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY AND NEVER STARTS WITH A SLASH (/).

cd Desktop

LINUX PROVIDES SHORTCUT IN RELATIVE PATHNAME - CURRENT OR PARENT DIRECTORY AS REFERENCE.
. (CURRENT DIRECTORY)
.. (PARENT DIRECTORY)

cd ..
